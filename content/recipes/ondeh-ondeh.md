    ingredients:
      - 100g grated gula melaka
      - 1 tbsp sugar
    directions:
      - Combine.
  - title: Sprinkles
    ingredients:
      - 275g grated coconut (white part only)
      - 1/4 tsp salt
    directions:
      - Steam coconut for 10 to 15 minutes then left to cool; this helps it to keep better

ingredients:
  - 150g pumpkin or sweet potatoes, cubed, steamed until soft and mashed
  - 200g glutinous rice flour
  - a pinch of salt
  - 100ml water
  - 1 tbsp tapioca flour

directions:
  - Bring water, salt and tapioca flour to a boil over low heat. Keep stirring until almost transparent.
  - Pour the mixture immediately in the glutinous rice flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir till it is well absorbed. Add the mashed pumpkin and mix well to form a dough. (If dough is too soft, add a little more glutinous rice flour.)
  - Divide dough into two and roll each portion into a longish roll. Cut into small pieces.
  - Bring water to a boil in a deep saucepan. Roll the pieces of dough into small balls with your palms. Then flatten the ball and put a bit of the sugar mixture in the centre.
  - Pinch to seal, then roll again into spheres. Drop the balls into boiling water until they float to the surface (about two to two and a half minutes).
  - Remove the cooked balls with a tea strainer. Roll in grated coconut to coat.
